## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me understand how to effectively manage state in a React application using Context API. I also improved my skills in building responsive layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox. Below are some code snippets showcasing what I learned:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to delve deeper into advanced state management solutions like Redux and explore more about server-side rendering with Next.js. Additionally, I want to refine my skills in creating more complex animations and transitions with CSS and JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - A great resource for web development documentation.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site helped me better understand CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation is always a go-to for understanding React concepts.
